# Elite Dangerous Reactive Lighting
---
This is a project to add reactive lighting to Elite: Dangerous for Corsair keyboards.
All keyboard profiles have been created for the Strafe MK2.
I don't know if this program works for any other keyboards, feedback is welcome.
---
I created this project because there is no other program to add reactive lighting for corsair keyboards yet.
The program uses a couple libraries and projects from other people, these are credited below.
